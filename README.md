# GenerateKMeansExamples
<h2>Create CSV files with built-in clusters so we can practice K-Means clustering</h2></br>
1. Edit the json file as needed.</br>
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook and it will process the json file. </br>
3. Look in the .txt file for the centroids that were used to create the CSV file and also the centroids that were computed when the data was K-Means processed.
 </br>
 </br>
 </br>
Other fun stuff: </br>
After generating the CSV file, the notebook code will plot the housing.csv file and the computed centroids</br>
